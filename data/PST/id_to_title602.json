ABSTRACT A fair amount of work has been done in recent years on reducing power consumption in caches by using a small instruction buffer placed between the execution pipe and a larger main cache [1,2,6]. These techniques, however, often degrade the overall system performance. In this paper, we propose using a small instruction buffer, also called a loop cache, to save power. A loop cache has no address tag store. It consists of a direct-mapped data array and a loop cache controller. The loop cache controller knows precisely whether the next instruction request will hit in the loop cache, well ahead of time. As a result, there is no performance degradation",

Much attention has been paid by academic/industrial communities to their development to ensure that the demanding requirements are met. For instance, object grasping [1], fault detection and diagnosis [2, 3], and robotic manipulation in space for on-orbit servicing [4], have been extensively investigated. It should be stressed that, high-accuracy control needs to be achieved in many applications. Motivated by this, many approaches inspired by modern control theories have been presented for robotic manipulators [5, 6]. Robotic manipulators are always subject to uncertain dynamics including unknown gravitational torque, unknown friction torque, disturbances, and uncertain inertia [7-9]. Those uncertainties are very difficult to be predicted in advance. This adversely affects the performance such as positioning accuracy",

After the error generation mechanism of current methods is revealed, a synchronous pattern matching (SPM) principle based residential CBL estimation approach without historical data requirement is proposed. All customers are split into DR and CONTROL group, including DR participants and non-DR customers, respectively. First, all CONTROL group customers are clustered into several non-overlapping clusters according to LPs similarity in the DR event day. Second, each DR participant is matched to the most similar cluster in the CONTROL group according to the similarity between its load curve segments (LCS) in DR event day, excluding DR part and cluster centroids. Third, the CBL of each DR participant is estimated with an optimized weight combination method using the load data within the DR event period of all the customers in the very matching cluster in the CONTROL group. A comparison with five well-known CBL estimation methods using a dataset of 736 residential customers indicates that the proposed approach has better overall performance than other current CBL estimation methods",

For example, some individuals might form a small alliance with the aim to refuse attempts to modify their preferences or even to move them against consensus to foster the alliance's own interests. In this paper, we propose a novel framework based on a self-management mechanism for non-cooperative behaviors in large-scale consensus reaching processes (LCRPs). In the proposed consensus reaching framework, experts are classified into different subgroups using a clustering method, and experts provide their evaluation information, i.e., the multi-criteria mutual evaluation matrices (MCMEMs), regarding the subgroups based on subgroups' performance (e.g., professional skills, cooperation, and fairness). The subgroups' weights are dynamically generated from the MCMEMs, which are in turn employed to update the individual experts' weights. This self-management mechanism in the LCRP allows penalizing the weights of the experts with non-cooperative behaviors. Detailed simulation experiments and comparison analysis are presented to verify the validity of the proposed framework for managing non-cooperative behaviors in the LCRP",

U-Net is a sophisticated encoder-decoder architecture which has been frequently used in medical image segmentation and has attained prominent performance. And asymmetric convolution block can enhance the square convolution kernels using asymmetric convolutions. In this paper, based on U-Net and asymmetric convolution block, we incorporate multi-scale features generated by different layers of U-Net and design a multi-scale skip connected architecture, MACU-Net, for semantic segmentation using high-resolution remote sensing images. Our design has the following advantages: (1) The multi-scale skip connections combine and realign semantic features contained both in low-level and high-level feature maps with different scales; (2) the asymmetric convolution block strengthens the representational capacity of a standard convolution layer. Experiments conducted on two remote sensing image datasets captured by separate satellites demonstrate that the performance of our MACU-Net transcends the U-Net, SegNet, DeepLab V3+, and other baseline algorithms",
